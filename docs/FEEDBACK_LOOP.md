# 🔄 Feedback Loop & Monitoring

This document outlines how **TripGenie** collects and uses user feedback to improve the quality of travel plans and maintain system performance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The feedback loop serves to:
- Measure user satisfaction
- Identify failed or low-quality responses
- Trigger alerts for manual review
- Support future improvements and model tuning

---

## 📥 Feedback Collection

After delivering an itinerary, the assistant asks:

> **"Was this plan helpful? 👍 or 👎"**

This is captured by:
- **Voiceflow**: Through button selection
- **Vapi**: Through voice prompt and intent classification
- **Webhook**: Sent to backend or automation tool (e.g., n8n)

### Example Payload

```json
{
  "trip_id": "abc123",
  "city": "Paris",
  "days": 3,
  "preferences": "romantic, food",
  "feedback": "positive"  // or "negative"
}
```

---

## 🔄 Automation Workflow (n8n)

When feedback is received, n8n performs the following actions:

### 1. Log to Google Sheets

| Column | Value |
|--------|-------|
| City | Paris |
| Days | 3 |
| Preferences | romantic, food |
| Feedback | 👍 / 👎 |
| Timestamp | 2025-04-05 14:22:33 |

### 2. Negative Feedback Handling

If feedback is **negative**, the system:
- Sends an alert to **Slack** or **Admin Email**
- Includes:
  - Full itinerary
  - User preferences
  - Timestamp
- Tags for manual review or model retraining

### 🚨 Slack Alert Example

```text
🚨 Negative Feedback Received
- User: Anonymous
- City: Paris
- Days: 3
- Preferences: luxury, food
- Issue: Itinerary had unrealistic timing
```

---

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

Google Sheets logs are used for:
- Satisfaction rate calculation
- Identifying common failure cases
- Tracking popular destinations
- Exporting data for reporting and tuning

### Sample Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Requests | 120 |
| Positive Feedback | 95 |
| Negative Feedback | 5 |
| Satisfaction Rate | 95.8% |

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

To enhance the feedback system:

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
- Use NLP to detect sentiment from open-ended feedback
- Example: "Too rushed" → tag as timing issue

### 2. Retraining Loop
- Collect corrected itineraries
- Fine-tune prompts or retrain model

### 3. Integration with LLM Evaluation Tools
- Use tools like **LangSmith** or **Weights & Biases** to track:
  - Prompt performance
  - Token usage
  - Latency
  - Accuracy

### 4. Auto-Retry on Negative Feedback
- Automatically regenerate itinerary with adjusted prompt
- Example: Add "make schedule more realistic"

## 🧪 Testing Feedback System

To test feedback handling:

1. Simulate a webhook POST to:
   ```
   POST /webhook/feedback
   ```

2. Body:
   ```json
   {
     "trip_id": "xyz789",
     "city": "Tokyo",
     "days": 2,
     "preferences": "food, culture",
     "feedback": "negative"
   }
   ```

3. Check:
   - Google Sheet updated
   - Slack alert sent (if configured)
   - Log file updated

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics

- No personal data is collected
- Feedback is anonymous
- All data is used only for system improvement
- Complies with GDPR and similar regulations
